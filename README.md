For the midterm project， I want to make an animation with music.
I want to make an animation of the cherry blossoms falling from a tree through processing. The size of the output sound is controlled by an infrared sensor and the speed at which the cherry blossoms fall through the humidity sensor.

## final project idea
In the final project, I want to explore the combination of Arduino and Processing. So I want to continue with what I started this semester. I want to control the animation through physical action. In this project, I want to control the fan with a temperature sensor, and the faster the fan, the more petals of the cherry tree will fall in the animation.
