For the midterm project， I want to make an animation with music.
I want to make an animation of the cherry blossoms falling from a tree through processing. The size of the output sound is controlled by an infrared sensor and the speed at which the cherry blossoms fall through the humidity sensor.

## final project idea
In the final project, I want to explore the combination of Arduino and Processing. So I want to continue with what I started this semester. I want to control the animation through physical action. In this project, I want to control the fan with a temperature sensor, and the faster the fan, the more petals of the cherry tree will fall in the animation.

input sensors:Humidity sensor

output sensor: fan  Processing

I'll first use processing to create an animation as shown below

## final project
In the final project, I successfully combined Processing and Arduino. The idea of controlling Processing animation through Arduino is realized. But because I broke the temperature sensor, I could only use potentiometer to control it as a fan switch. When the fan is turned on, the processing trees fall. And when the fan is shut off, the cherry blossoms stop falling.
